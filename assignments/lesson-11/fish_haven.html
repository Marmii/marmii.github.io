                <p class="colorrun">Yesterday, a man was found dead in a field not far from our quaint little town of Fish Haven, Idaho. Police say he was on a plane headed to New York, when the plane hit turbulence and its passengers prepared for an emergency landing. The plane later landed in Kentucky after the turbulence had passed to check for damage. Everyone was unharmed but one man was unaccounted for. <br>
                    <br>
                    That brings us back to our crime scene. Reports from the passengers are all the same. Everyone was slightly panicked and was worried about themselves and didn’t see him leave the plane with or without help. Police suspect that this hapless man was scared for his life and thought jumping out was the only way to survive. Unfortunately, no one has been known to survive a drop from thousands of feet in the air. With nothing to break his fall, he died on impact.. He had been there for less than 2 days, when his body was discovered by the farmer who owns the field. <br>
                    <br>
                    Farmer Frank said, “ I was just ridin’ along in my tractor cuttin’ the hay when I noticed that part of it was not standin’ up straight. So I got out of my tractor and walked to what I thought was maybe a nest of ducks or a baby deer or somethin’. Instead I walked up to the mayhem and carnage of a broken body. I will never be able to rid myself of the image.” <br>
                    <br>
                    The farmer has reached out to the friends and family to offer his condolences and our hearts are with them as they go through this troubling time. Let this be a lesson for anyone who thinks jumping out of a plane is a good idea.<br>
