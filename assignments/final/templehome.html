            <p class="spotlight">
                Nestled near the Wasatch Mountains and across from the historic Brigham City Tabernacle is the Brigham City Temple.
                This temple was announced on October 3, 2009 by President Thomas S. Monson and dedicated on
                September 23, 2012 by President Boyd K. Packer. It is the 151st temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
                This temple, along with many others, boasts a rich heritage.The Brigham City Temple is a smaller temple and therefore gives a more intimate
                setting for your special occasion. Our facility is within walking distance to the hotel, so there is no need for a transport, although transport 
                is available for those with special needs. While this temple does not offer clothing rentals, our Brigham City location offers temple clothing rentals to those who hold a current temple recommend.
                <br>
                Come enjoy this beautiful temple and its amazing views of the sunset!
